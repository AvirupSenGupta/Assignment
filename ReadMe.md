### The repository contains two other files:
* (1) a script *run_analysis.R* for performing the analysis, and 
* (2) a code book ("CodeBook.md") that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 

### The script *run_analysis.R* perfrms the following task:
* (1) downloads and calls all the require libraries (if those are not already downloaded).
* (2) sets up a main directory (working directory)
* (3) downloads the data from the given url.
* (4) unzips the data in a separate sub-directory within the working directory.
* (5) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* (6) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* (7) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* (8) labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* (9) creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
* (10) writes the output in a text file.


### The code book *CodeBook.md* that 
* (2) step by step  tasks that cleaned up the data and 
* (1) describes the variables of the tidy data.
